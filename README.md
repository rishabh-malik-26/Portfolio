Diabetes Prediction

This project focuses on predicting diabetes using machine learning models. It involves extensive experimentation with different algorithms, feature selection techniques, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. A key priority was balancing evaluation metrics, particularly minimizing false negatives, to ensure that at-risk patients are accurately identified. The project also includes detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to improve model accuracy and interpretability.

Amazon NLP-Based Recommender

Developed a product recommendation system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project involved preprocessing product descriptions, implementing a Word2Vec model from scratch to generate word embeddings, and utilizing cosine similarity to measure product similarity. The goal was to enhance recommendations by capturing semantic relationships between products. This project demonstrates skills in text processing, vectorization techniques, and recommendation system development.
